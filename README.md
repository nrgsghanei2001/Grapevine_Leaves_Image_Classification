# Grapevine Leaf Classification

## Project Overview

This project involves the classification of grapevine leaf images using data mining techniques. The goal is to accurately identify and categorize different types of grapevine leaves based on their visual features.

## Key Features

- **Dataset and Data Augmentation:**
  - Utilized the dataset of grapevine leaf images, including data augmentation techniques to enhance model training.
  - Data augmentation methods were applied to increase the variety and volume of training images.

- **Model Architecture:**
  - Implemented Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification tasks.
  - Used libraries such as Keras and PyTorch for building and training CNN models.
  - Leveraged pre-trained models (VGG19, ResNet, ...) to improve classification performance.

- **Dimensionality Reduction and Denoising:**
  - Applied autoencoders for denoising and dimensionality reduction.

- **Evaluation and Validation:**
  - Employed 10-fold cross-validation to prevent overfitting.
  - Used a confusion matrix to visualize model performance and identify areas for improvement.

## Disclaimer

This project is a simplified implementation designed for educational purposes in a data mining course. It provides a foundational understanding of image classification and does not have all possible complexities.
